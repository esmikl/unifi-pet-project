# PetProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.3, and was built using [Unifi Angular](https://angular.unifi.nelnet.io/).

## Development
- Clone the repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/esmikl/unifi-pet-project.git`
- From the root of the project, run `npm install` to install the dependencies. NOTE: You must have access to either GLHEC Artifactory or Nelnet Artifactory, and have your .npmrc file set up accordingly.
- Start up the development server: `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
